# Notes

* Buy a new keyboard
* You are using TS, but not typing stuff
* You really need to think about design in terms of separation of concerns
* Start to think about tests declaratively. Only thing that should break the test is the change of the behaviour, not change in implementation
* * With your code as well. Nice way to think about it: You should either ONLY call other functions, or write their implementation. 
* FORMAT THE DAMN CODE.
* While I like your git commit messages, you need ot start doing a commits that are atomic, and sometimes use rebase/squash. Two "Update README.md" in a row, in the span of 2 minutes? Squash it. If you use "and" in the commit message, split it to two (or more) commits. Commit named "small refactor" tells me nothing
